## Vulnerabilitys
"So I was installing my trusty little software, with securaty issues oc. I mean the warning was yellow... However I installed it and to my surprise, it deleted operatv4.5system. But it wanst the launcher it self, it was the modding thingy MCentres. You can still boot windows only if you go in your bios and boot from your SSD, not Windows Boot Manager. Be aware out there my friends :)"

When trying to boot normaly there is a black screen with this text: missing operatv4.5system

To fix it, go into the bios and boot from your SSD, not "Windows Boot Manager"

For your own safety, you should backup your most neccecary files(NOT ALL OF THEM, as they could include viruses) and reinstall windows.
